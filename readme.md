## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

The title of my website would be "Artifacts of History" with the first artifact being the Rosetta Stone. The goal of the website would be to try and educate users about different artifacts and there historical significance. I chose the Rosetta Stone to be the first artifact because I found it interesting how it has helped scholars decipher Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The Rosetta Stone is a stone of black granodiorite that was created in 196 BC and was discovered in 1799 near Rosetta, Nile Delta, Egypt. The stone contains three inscriptions: one in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, one in Egyptian Demotic script, and one in Ancient Greek. The original purpose of the stone was a decree that established the divine cult of King Ptolemy V nine years into his reign. Between the three inscriptions, there are only minor differences in what they say. Due to this, scholars in the 1800s were able to use the stone to help decipher some Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs which had been forgotten since the the 5th century. However, due to damage of the stone, only a limited amount of hieroglyphs were deciphered. Fortunately, there have been three other decrees containing Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions that have been found: the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV in 218 BC.

### Core Webpages

To start out, the website will contain four pages: Home page, Artifacts page, Rosetta Stone page, and Contact page. This design will allow for the addition of other artifacts in the future. All pages will have a navigation bar at the top that will contain links to the Home page, Artifacts page, and contact page.

Home Page:
 - Contains a brief description of what the website is
 - Has a location that displays the newest artifacts added to the website

Artifacts Page:
 - Contains the different artifacts that are displayed on the website
 - Will allow for different ways to display the artifacts (alphabetical, current location, place of origin)

Rosetta Stone Page:
 - Has basic information of the artifact (picture, current location, place of origin, date created, date found)
 - A detailed description of what the artifact is
 - Information on how the artifact has helped scholars understand history
 - An intractable 3D model of the artifact that users can rotate and zoom in/out on
 - An intractable that allows users to select one of the three inscriptions and translate what is recorded on the stone

Contact Page:
 - A section that has a way to contact me incase there are any issues with the website or if there is incorrect information in the website

### Design Choices

As stated in the Core Webpages section, all pages will have a navigation bar at the top of the page. This navigation bar will be similar to what we have created in this class. For the navigation bar, I'll use the color sea-foam green because it is a moral booster. The rest of the page will have a white background.

Home page: 
 - Has the description section at the top of the page
 - Has the three newest artifacts displayed beneath it (This section will have a light gray background)
 - I have a visual of how I want the page to be, however, I couldn't think of any websites that follows this format

Artifacts page:
 - A filter at the top of the page, this will most likely be either a drop down or a click the bubble selection (This section will have a light gray background)
 - Depending on how the user has it filtered, it will have multiple lists that have a header (ie. alphabetical headers: A, B, C. Current location headers: British Museum, Unknown. Place of Origin: Egypt, China)

Rosetta Stone page:
 - Right side of the screen will have the basic information (This section will have a light gray background)
 - Detailed description will be created to the left of the basic information section
 - Under the detailed description will be the intractable 3D model, depending on its size, the other intractable will either be beside it or under neath it

Contact page:
 - A small paragraph that asks users to report any issues with the website at the top of the page
 - A section that contains an email to contact me at
